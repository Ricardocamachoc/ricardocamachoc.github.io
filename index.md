My name is Ricardo. I'm a PhD candidate in Geomatics at the Centre for Spatial Data Infrastructure and Land Administration ([CSDILA](https://eng.unimelb.edu.au/csdila)) and the Centre for Disaster Management and Public Safety ([CDPMS](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/cdmps)) at [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/).  I am co-supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Jagannath Aryal](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/865150-jagannath-aryal) and [Prof. Abbas Rajabifard](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/6142-abbas-rajabifard). Before I started my PhD, I was fortunate enough to work as a researcher and lecturer in Geomatics at [Universidad de Los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co/), where I collaborated closely with the Research Group on Urban and Regional Sustainability ([SUR](https://sur.uniandes.edu.co/) and the Research Portfolio on Historical Ecology and Social Memory ([EHMS](https://ehms.uniandes.edu.co/)).

I obtained a BS in Civil Engineering and a BS in Environmental Engineering at the [Universidad de Los Andes](https://uniandes.edu.co/) in Bogotá, Colombia. After this, I obtained my MSc in Civil Engineering for Risk Mitigation at [Politecnico di Milan](https://www.polimi.it/en) in Italy.

## What is my research about?

Informal urban growth presents a challenge that some cities worldwide have seen during the past few decades. As the population grows and spreads, the informal settlements expand, joining the urban dynamics that characterise a city. However, these dynamics are usually disrupted after a disastrous event, challenging public policies.

My research involves understanding how informal urban settlements' spatial dynamics and distribution change before and after a disaster and how this change challenges the public policies on legalisation, recovery, and resilience. I am dealing with spatial, social, and policy aspects surrounding informal urban settlements in disaster-prone cities.
