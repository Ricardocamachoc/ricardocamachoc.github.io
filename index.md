My <img class="profile-picture" src=/Ricardo_squared.jpg> name is Ricardo. I'm a PhD candidate in Geomatics at the Centre for Spatial Data Infrastructure and Land Administration [CSDILA](https://eng.unimelb.edu.au/csdila) and the Centre for Disaster Management and Public Safety [CDPMS](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/cdmps) at [The University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au/).  I am co-supervised by [Assoc. Prof. Jagannath Aryal](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/865150-jagannath-aryal) and [Prof. Abbas Rajabifard](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/6142-abbas-rajabifard). Before I started my PhD, I was fortunate enough to collaborate closely with professor [Christopher Rossbach](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~rossbach/) on heterogeneous computing systems at [SCEA group](https://github.com/utcs-scea). I also worked with professor [Simon Peter](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~simpeter/) on programmable switches.

My research focuses on the intersection of operating systems, network, and machine learning. I am particularly interested in developing systems for ML, and applying ML techniques to systems.

I obtained both MS and BS in Computer Science at the [UT Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), where I worked on modernizing GPU benchmarking and accelerating OS kernel access to accelerators.
